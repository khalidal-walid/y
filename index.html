				<h1>Fake Job Advertisement Detection</h1>
				Nowadays, people are becoming more dependent on technology. Most of critical procedures of company are already conducted through Software as a Service (SaaS) products. It also involves the hiring process in company. Before this, company use to print out the job advertisement and stick in on the wall in certain area. The disadvantage of this method is company cannot approach future workers that live far away from their company that have the ability to contribute to their company. <br><br>

				But, the method has changes throughout the rapid development of technology. Hiring company can publish their job advertisement through any job pportal or their own website. On the downside, this method has attracted the interest of scammers. In most cases, the scammers will disguise themselves from the company to get the information of the job seekers. This problem may jeopardizes job seekers’ privacy and merosakkan credibility of company. <br><br>
				
				In this project, we will use “Fake Job Postings” dataset which is available on Kaggle. There are 18 variables for 17880 job advertisements. Target variable indicates if the job advertisements is fraud or not. Since the target variable has two states (not fraud/fraud or 0/1), this is a binary classification problem. <br><br>
				
				The variables are: ‘job_id’ ,’title’,’location’, ‘department’, ‘salary_range’, ‘company_profile’, ‘description’, ‘requirements’, ‘benefits’, ‘telecommuting’, ‘has_company_logo’, ‘has_questions’, ‘fraudulent’, ‘employment_type’, ‘required_experience’, ‘required_education’, ‘industry’ and ‘function’. <br><br>
				
				At first glance, only job_id seems irrelevant to the status of job advertisement. Other variables may or may not have an effect on it. We will figure it out. <br><br> </p>

								We start the data analysis by looking for missing values and handle them. The dataset we used is highly unbalanced. It is because of missing values due to the fact that fraudsters was not doing their job well to disguise themselves. 
							</p>
							<img src="./c1.svg" alt="" />
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								To solve this issues, we decide to analyse data that contained all significant information. Then, we trained our cleaned dataset with two different classification models. 
							</p>
							<img src="./c2.svg" alt="" />
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								After we do data cleaning, our new dataset consists of 774 columns. We would like to start analysing with the target variable (fraudulent):
							</p>
							<img src="./c3.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								Target variable has imbalanced class distribution. Positive class (fraudulent = 0) is significantly higher that negative class (fraudulent = 1). The imbalanced class distributions can influence the performance of our models negatively. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								It is beneficial to explore our variables before trying to build a model. Firstly, we discover the variables that only have two values or binominal attributes.
							</p>
							<img src="./c4.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								The remaining categorical variables that have more than two values is also called as polynominal attributes.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								<b>Binary Categorical Variables</b>
							</p>
							<img src="./c5.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								There is a high imbalance in “telecommuting” and “has_company_logo” variables. Most of the job advertisements have a company logo and similarly, true for telecommuting positions. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								It is better to check how the target variable (fraudulent) changes according to the binary variables. 
							</p>
							<img src="./c6.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								From the analysis above, it shows the binary variables have an effect on the target variable. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								<b>Polynominal Categorical Variables</b><br><br>There are 14 variables that includes in this category. But, we can only show the analysis of three variables only which are “employment_type”, “required_experiment” and “required_education”. <br/><br/>Now, we can check the influence of polynominal variables towards our target variable. 
							</p>
							<img src="./c8.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								For other variables, we cannot show the analysis because of too many different input by every variables.

							<p class="text-lg">
								<b>Conclusion</b>
							</p>
							<p class="text-lg">
								From the explatorarory data analysis, we decide to not exclude any variables. It is because, for every variables, it will bring impact for our model. To continue our analysis, we will use RapidMiner.

								We chose a Naive Bayesian model because it is easy to compute and because the variables in the given dataset are all independent of each other. It is the primary assumption before doing our Naive Bayesian model. 
							</p>
							<img src="./nb-latest.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								As we can see that Bayes Navesian works really well with the given dataset, with the accuracy rate 90.80%. However, there is still a vast majority of the dataset which is 9.2% cannot be correctly classified. This means our job seeker still misjudged one tenth of job advertisement out there. We will attempt to improve the result by using our initial dataset which is pre-cleaned dataset. 
							</p>
							<img src="./nb-lama.svg" alt="">
							<p class="text-lg">
								As you can see, there is slightly different result between this two models. The model that use clean dataset is more accurate compared to our initial dataset. We can assume this model will bring more disadvantage if the data entries has many missing values in it.
							</p>

				<div id="tab-3-content" class="tab-content-item">

						<div>
							<p class="text-lg">
								For our second model, we chose a kNN model.
							</p>
							<img src="./kNN-latest.svg" alt="" />
							<p class="text-lg">
								As we can see that kNN model works really well compared to Naive Bayes, with the accuracy rate 93.87%. We will also attempt to improve the result by using our initial dataset which is pre-cleaned dataset. 
							</p>
							<img src="./kNN-lama.svg" alt="">
							<p class="text-lg">
								Compared to Naive Bayes model, kNN model give more accuracy result even though the dataset has many missing values. For overall, kNN model contribute a higher percentage for our job seeker to avoid being persuaded with fake job advertisement.
