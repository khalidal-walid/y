      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2><br>In this new era, there are many jobs advertisement display on many types of media like newspaper, poster even in social media. People with different types of education levels are searching for job through the advertisement. There are several bad people that want our data by creating fake job advertisement so the innocent people will give their data by applying the jobs. This will give a really bad consequences if the bad people will get our data. In this assignment, we are making analysis on what attribute will be the main cause of the job advertisement become fake and how can we predict the advertisement is fake.</h2>

                After that we will remove table that have description that cannot be used as nominal or binomial data. The data cannot be use because the difference between each data is very different and cannot be used as data. Such as job_id, title, salary_range, company_profile, description, requirement, benefits.<br><br>
                Now all data has been clean we will now use PowerBI as our dashboard to visualize the fake job posting data.<br><br>

								<br><br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
								Based on our descriptive analysis it shows that missing value is a huge contribution to a fraudulent in a job posting. This make us consider it as a value when going into predictive analysis.<br><br>
								We can conclude that if a job hunter want to search for company to work for make sure it have all description provided before accepting the job.

								The first machine learning model is Decision Tree

								<br>As shown in picture the Naïve Bayesian model give an accuracy at 94.30% that is consider accurate but not as accurate as Decision Tree Model.

								The last one is using the Neural Network Model

							<img src="./image/14.png" />

							<p class="text-lg">
								<br>Neural Network have little bit higher accuracy than Decision Tree Model that is 97.47% which is only 0.14% higher than Decision Tree Model.<br><br>

								This make us decide to use Neural Network to predict any fraudulent in job posting to make sure it is not fake.<br><br>

								<b>Summary</b><br><br>

								We learn that even though all of them are machine learning model but each model give out difference output based on attribute provided. This could mean that each model react differently in different data provided. So we need to pick the best accuracy from the model been test on before we test on real time data to make sure it give out the most accurate result. This is very important if something need a real time accuracy such as air traffic to make sure no airplanes collide or the airplanes did not land accurately that could lead to fatal for people in the airplane and also people on the ground.
